If your Zookeeper node is running as a service (found under /lib/systemd/system/) from a recent Confluent Platform release, you can start it using:

[source,shell]
----
systemctl start confluent-zookeeper
----

Otherwise, you can start your broker using:

[source,shell]
----
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
----
