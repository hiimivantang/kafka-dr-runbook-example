If your Zookeeper node is running as a service (found under /lib/systemd/system/) from a recent Confluent Platform release, you can start it using:

[source,shell]
----
systemctl start confluent-zookeeper
----

Otherwise, you can start Zookeeper server with:

[source,shell]
----
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
----

To validate if your server has successfully joined the quorum, run the following and verify if `Mode` is either `follower` or `leader`:

[source,shell]
----
echo stat | nc localhost 2181  | grep Mode
---- 

TIP: If `stat` command is disabled, enable it by including it in the `4lw.commands.whitelist` property within `zookeeper.properties`.
