If your Kafka broker is running as a service (found under /lib/systemd/system/) from a recent Confluent Platform release, you can restart it using:

[source,shell]
----
systemctl restart confluent-server
----

Otherwise, you can start your broker using:

[source,shell]
----
bin/kafka-server-stop
bin/kafka-server-start config/server.properties
----
