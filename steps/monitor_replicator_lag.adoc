Ensure Replicator is caught up and replication lag is not growing.
If the replication lag keeps growing, it indicates that Replicator throughput is lower than what gets produced to the origin cluster and that additional Replicator tasks or Connect Workers are necessary.

[TIP]
====
The recommended way to monitor Replicator is with Confluent Control Center and the https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/multi-dc-deployments/replicator/replicator-monitoring.html#crep-monitoring-extension[Replicator monitoring extension]. 

Additionally, Replicator needs to be configured with https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/control-center/installation/clients.html#confluent-monitoring-interceptors[Confluent Monitoring Interceptors]
