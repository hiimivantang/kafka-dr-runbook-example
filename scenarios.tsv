ZK1	Single node failure	Zookeeper Outage	One ZooKeeper goes offline. Server breaks or maintenance restart
K1	Single node failure	Kafka Outage	One Kafka server goes offline. Server breaks or maintenance restart
KD1	Single node failure	Kafka Disk Failure	Single disk failure. SAN storage with redundancy guarantee.
ZK2	Two nodes failure	ZooKeeper Outage	Two ZooKeeper instances within a DC go offline.
K2	Two nodes failure	Kafka Outage	Two broker servers within a DC go offline. Server breaks or human error during maintenance.
DC1	Single DC failure	Full datacenter failure	Full datacenter (e.g. disaster, power outage, DC switch failure) outage
R1	Single region failure	Full regional failure	Full regional (e.g. disaster, power outage, catastrophic network issue) outage resulting in both DCs within the region to be offline.
N1	Intra-DC network failure	Network segmentation within DC	Network segmentation within a DC, e.g. rack switch failure, that affects some of the DC's brokers, ZK nodes, SR instance, or C3 instance.
N2	Inter-DC network segmentation	Network segmentation between DC	Network segmentation between 2 DCs, e.g. DC switch failure, affecting entire region.
N3	Inter-region network segmentation	Network segmentation between Regions	Network segmentation between regions, resulting in loss of connectivity between the (stretched) cluster in each region.
KS1	Single node failure	Kafka Streams Application failure	One Kafka Streams application instance failure resulting in tasks running in failed instance to be reassigned to other instances (if any).
US1	Complete upstream failure	Channel failure	A complete failure for upstream system resulting in the inability for Producers to pull and produce into Kafka topics.
DS1	Complete downstream failure	Channel failure	A complete failure for downstream system resulting in the inability for downstream Consumers to sink processed events.
Q1	Partial downstream failure	Channel failure	A partial failure for downstream (for e.g. full queue) resulting in the inability for downstream Consumer to sink some of the processed events.
CW1	Single node failure	Connect worker failure	One connect worker failure resulting in tasks running in the failed worker to be reassigned to remaining workers (if any).
